Here's a brief description of each file and the functions they could contain:

- app.py: This is the main Flask application file. It contains the route definitions and the main application setup.

- text_generation.py: This file contains functions related to text generation. For example, it could contain a function generate_text(prompt) that takes a prompt and returns the generated text from the OpenAI API.

- image_generation.py: This file contains functions related to image generation. For example, it could contain a function generate_images(scenery_descriptions) that takes a list of scenery descriptions and returns a list of filenames of the generated images.

- video_generation.py: This file contains functions related to video generation. For example, it could contain a function generate_video(image_filenames) that takes a list of image filenames and returns the filename of the generated video.

- images/: This directory stores the generated images.

- videos/: This directory stores the generated videos.

This structure separates the different parts of your application into their own modules, making the code easier to understand and maintain. Each function does one specific task, following the principle of single responsibility.
